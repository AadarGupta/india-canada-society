The committee's work and interest in the fight against racism generated significant civic awareness on the issue, eventually leading to the formation the Mayor's Race Relations Committee."},{option:"Community Engagement",content:"With an explicit intention to contribute to the variety of Canadian life and experience, the Society has actively sought to facilitate mainstream dialogue around the rich Indian philosophy and culture. For example, over the last twenty-five years, the Society has cooperatively hosted major national and international speakers and has helped celebrate the work and life of such preminent Indian figures in arts, culture and philosophy. \n    \n    These include: Gandhi, Tagore, Radhakrishnan, Vinoba Bhave, Ramanujan, Nehru, Aurobindo, Ravi Shankar, and Rukmini Devi Arundale. For this it has worked very closely with various departments at McMaster University (History, Music, Religion, Philosophy, Political Science, Women's Study, Peace Centre etc.). \n    \n    The Society continually strives to remain engaged in issues of specific interest to the Indo-Canadian community by undertaking and supporting initiatives such as creating workgroups that focus on the special needs of community women, and youths. More recently the Society is actively participating in a grassroots effort to shape provincial health policy aimed at seniors “aging at home.”"},{option:"Member Mobilization",content:"The Society holds a number of events for its members.
